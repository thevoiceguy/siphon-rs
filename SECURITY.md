# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We support security fixes only for the latest release of each crate in this
workspace. Older versions are not guaranteed to receive security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security issues privately to the maintainers.

- Preferred: Open a GitHub Security Advisory at
  https://github.com/thevoiceguy/siphon-rs/security/advisories/new
- If you cannot use GitHub advisories, open a private discussion at
  https://github.com/thevoiceguy/siphon-rs/discussions and request a maintainer
  to move the report to a private channel.

When reporting, include:

- A detailed description of the issue and impact
- Steps to reproduce or a proof-of-concept
- Affected crate(s) and versions
- Any known mitigations or workarounds

We aim to acknowledge reports within 72 hours and provide a timeline for a fix
once the issue is confirmed. Please do not disclose security issues publicly
until a fix is available.
